Joshua was super responsive when we first inquired about tutoring services and quickly matched up my child with someone who could help him with AP Calc. The sessions have been working out well for him, and he feels his tutor helps him understand the material more easily than his teacher at school.",

She did her best to make sure I understood the concepts before moving on and explained everything in a way that was easy to understand. She has a very positive attitude, which makes her great to have as a tutor. I'm not the best at math or remembering things, so I needed a review and help with some new concepts I've been learning in class. I will definitely be booking more sessions with her in the future.",

Joshua's approach helped my shy daughter feel comfortable, and she even found him to be a better teacher than her school instructor. He quickly covered all the necessary material in a short time frame, showing exceptional responsiveness, reliability, and strategic planning. His prompt replies to questions and punctuality were crucial, given the last-minute task asked of him.",
