  "text": "Tutoring often feels more like a business transaction rather than a genuine learning experience. As a group of College Students, we are changing that by focusing on personal connections. Our team understands your journey because weâ€™ve been there ourselves. Weâ€™re students tooâ€”just a little further along the road. Whether weâ€™re studying, working out, or pursuing hobbies like hiking or sports, we share the same drive for growth and discovery. At CalTutors, youâ€™ll find more than tutors; youâ€™ll find mentors, friends, and a support system dedicated to helping you thrive. Join us, and letâ€™s grow together. ðŸŒŸ.",
